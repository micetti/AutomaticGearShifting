# AutomaticGearShifting
Using an Arduino, a Smartphone and a Bike with Shimanos Di2 to create an automatic gear shifting bike.


The code of the AutomaticShiftingNoMatlab.ino is well commented. This code is more aimed at inspiring others to build an own automatic gear shifting bike, rather than being an step by step instruction how to do that. If someone actually wants do that and need more help you can still ask me. e-mail is in the header of the code files.
