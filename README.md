# AutomaticGearShifting
Using an Arduino, a Smartphone, a Bluetooth module and a Bike with Shimanos Di2 to create an automatic gear shifting bike.

What does it do? 
With the right wiring of the above mentioned components, the code of this project, enables one to build a bike that will always shift into the fitting gear in respective to the chosen crank frequency and your current speed.

The code of the AutomaticShiftingNoMatlab.ino is well commented. This code is more aimed at inspiring others to build an own automatic gear shifting bike, rather than being an step by step instruction how to do that. If someone actually wants do that and needs more help, you can still ask me. E-mail is in the header of the code files.

The code for the mentioned app, which is necessary for changing settings without having to copile a new scetch might be uploaded soon.
